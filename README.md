# Simple Script for Upload Entire Encrypted Disk to SiaSky.Net Service
# This script was tested only on Linux Ubuntu 20 but the concept should be easy for transfer to other platforms. 

First of all:
Neither the SiaSky.net Partners nor the SIA Foundation have had any involvement in the development of this proof of concept and under no circumstances are there any guarantees of performance now or in the future, so please consider yourself a developer if you use this script and please do so with extreme caution, as you may incur loss of data. 

About SiaSky.Net:
SiaSky.Net is The decentralized CDN and file sharing platform for devs. Skynet is the storage foundation for a Free Internet!. 

Why this POC? Unlike Siac, the SiaSky Web Service does not encrypt documents uploaded to SiaSky, so anyone who knows the link it generates could access the data.  With the assurance that your data is encrypted at source, you need not worry about uploading it to SiaSky. Not Wallet or SiaCoins Requiered for upload unlimited data.

The main reason for thinking about the realization of this proof of concept, has been nothing more than trying to generate interest in Sia's technology that I consider is very good, and create something of Mass Adoption by Internet users through a simple script easy to read and interpret and therefore to customize, with the aim that users can create local encrypted disks on your computer, fill them with information and upload them safely and free to the Sia Network, and then retrieve it only keeping the link file and of course the encryption password. All this, without requiring the installation of a Wallet or the purchase of Siacoins by the user. 

Many thanks for the courtesy of all the partners who maintain the SiaSky.net storage, without them, this test would not have been possible.
